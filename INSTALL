## When you need install yourself ##
If 'bach-linux' and 'bach-mac' cannot work on your system, you might have to install yourself.

'bach-linux' and 'bach-mac' have GMP library statically linked and were compiled on old computers. Hence they should work on most Linux or MAC systems.

## Install GMP ##
First, you need install GMP library. You can download from gmplib.org.

BE SURE to include '--enable-cxx' argument when you type './configure'. Otherwise the C++ interface of GMP will not be installed and the compilation of our code will fail.

## Install bach ##
Type 'make' to compile bach. 

Note that you may need to specify the 'include' and 'lib' paths of GMP. Open the Makefile and you should see how to add them. It should look like 

	INC = -I/usr/local/include
	LIB = -L/usr/local/lib

Lastly, move 'bach' to a directory in the PATH variable so that you can use it by typing 'bach' anywhere.
